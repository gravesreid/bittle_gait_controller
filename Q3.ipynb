    "Given an esp32 based quadruped robot, the Petoi Bittle robot, we want to use trajectory optimization and control to create closed loop gaits for locomotion. The robot has existing open loop gaits, but these are not optimal and rely on sliding the feet across the floor to maintain stability this presents a problem anytime the surface the robot is walking on is smooth, like hardwood or tile floor. The only sensor we have access to is the IMU, which presents a unique challenge. If we restrict ourselves to crawling motions, then this allows us to rely on the polygon (or triangle) of stability, then we have something we can optimize- the stability margin of the projection of the robot center of mass into this polygon created by three legs that we assume are in contact. So the general idea is to have a schedule for the order of foot movement, and then determine the optimal joint angles for the maximal stability margin, and then the free leg can take a step forward. So there are two main components here:\n",
    "1) Determine the optimal joint angles for maximal stability- Optimization problem\n",
    "2) A controller that adjusts the three legs in contact with the ground to maintain stability while the free leg is moving to the next step"
